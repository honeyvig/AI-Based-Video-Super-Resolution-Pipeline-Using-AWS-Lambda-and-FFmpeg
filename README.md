# AI-Based-Video-Super-Resolution-Pipeline-Using-AWS-Lambda-and-FFmpeg
To build a Deep Video Super-Resolution (DVS) solution that operates within AWS Lambda, you need to consider several key aspects, such as efficiently running AI models on limited resources, managing video processing tasks, and leveraging AWS services for storage and computational power. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to approach each component and the Python code that can be used to build the solution.
Key Components:

    Preprocessing:
        Extract frames from videos using FFmpeg.
        Store frames in AWS Lambda's /tmp directory or directly in an S3 bucket.

    AI Model Integration:
        Use state-of-the-art super-resolution models such as TecoGAN, EDVR, or Real-ESRGAN.
        Optimize models for efficient inference within AWS Lambda (convert models to ONNX or use TensorFlow Lite).

    Post-Processing:
        Reassemble frames into a video using FFmpeg.
        Maintain temporal consistency in the output video.

    AWS Integration:
        Fetch input videos from S3, process them, and upload the enhanced output back to S3.

    Performance Optimization:
        Ensure the process works within AWS Lambda's memory, storage, and time limits (10 GB memory, 15 minutes runtime, 10 GB storage).
        Handle real-time or near-real-time processing for short videos.

    Testing & Documentation:
        Test with different videos.
        Provide detailed deployment and maintenance documentation.

Solution Design:

We will break this down into manageable steps, followed by example Python code.
Step 1: Extract Frames from Video Using FFmpeg

In AWS Lambda, video processing can be achieved by extracting frames from videos before applying the super-resolution AI models. FFmpeg can be used to extract frames and then store them temporarily in the /tmp directory or S3.

import subprocess
import os
import boto3

# FFmpeg command to extract frames
def extract_frames(input_video_path, output_frames_path):
    os.makedirs(output_frames_path, exist_ok=True)
    
    # FFmpeg command to extract frames from video
    command = [
        'ffmpeg',
        '-i', input_video_path,
        '-vf', 'fps=1',  # Extract 1 frame per second (adjustable)
        os.path.join(output_frames_path, 'frame%04d.jpg')  # Output frames in numbered sequence
    ]
    
    subprocess.run(command)

# Example to process a video from S3
def process_video_from_s3(input_s3_path, output_s3_path, tmp_dir='/tmp'):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Download video from S3
    s3.download_file(input_s3_path.bucket, input_s3_path.key, '/tmp/input_video.mp4')
    
    # Extract frames using FFmpeg
    extract_frames('/tmp/input_video.mp4', tmp_dir)
    
    # Upload the extracted frames to S3 (optional, for debugging purposes)
    for frame_file in os.listdir(tmp_dir):
        if frame_file.endswith('.jpg'):
            s3.upload_file(os.path.join(tmp_dir, frame_file), output_s3_path.bucket, f'frames/{frame_file}')

Step 2: Load and Optimize Super-Resolution Models for Lambda

For efficient inference, you'll need to optimize the super-resolution models for Lambda. You can convert models to the ONNX format or use TensorFlow Lite to reduce size and inference time.

For this example, let’s assume you have the model ready as an ONNX file.

import onnxruntime as ort

# Load pre-trained ONNX model for super-resolution
def load_model(model_path):
    session = ort.InferenceSession(model_path)
    return session

# Super-resolution inference
def apply_super_resolution(session, frame):
    # Prepare the input tensor (resize, normalize, etc.)
    input_tensor = frame.reshape(1, 3, 256, 256)  # Example input shape for a model (adjust based on your model)
    
    # Run inference
    inputs = {session.get_inputs()[0].name: input_tensor}
    result = session.run(None, inputs)
    
    # Post-process the result
    super_resolved_frame = result[0]
    
    return super_resolved_frame

Step 3: Reassemble Enhanced Frames Into Video

After enhancing the frames, reassemble them into a video using FFmpeg, ensuring temporal consistency.

def reassemble_video(output_video_path, input_frames_path, frame_rate=30):
    # FFmpeg command to reassemble frames into video
    command = [
        'ffmpeg',
        '-framerate', str(frame_rate),
        '-i', os.path.join(input_frames_path, 'frame%04d.jpg'),
        '-c:v', 'libx264',
        '-r', str(frame_rate),
        '-pix_fmt', 'yuv420p',
        output_video_path
    ]
    
    subprocess.run(command)

Step 4: AWS Lambda Integration

You will leverage AWS Lambda to handle the entire process by using S3 for video storage, Lambda functions for execution, and Amazon S3 for video upload/download.

Here’s an example Lambda function to process the video:

import json
import boto3
import os
import tempfile

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Get the input and output S3 paths from the event
    input_s3_path = event['input_s3_path']
    output_s3_path = event['output_s3_path']
    
    # Temporary directory for storing frames and model
    tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Step 1: Download the input video from S3 to /tmp
    s3.download_file(input_s3_path['bucket'], input_s3_path['key'], '/tmp/input_video.mp4')
    
    # Step 2: Extract frames using FFmpeg
    extract_frames('/tmp/input_video.mp4', tmp_dir)
    
    # Step 3: Load model and apply super-resolution to each frame
    model = load_model('/tmp/super_res_model.onnx')
    
    for frame_file in os.listdir(tmp_dir):
        if frame_file.endswith('.jpg'):
            # Load frame (image preprocessing is needed here)
            frame = load_image(os.path.join(tmp_dir, frame_file))
            
            # Apply super-resolution to the frame
            super_resolved_frame = apply_super_resolution(model, frame)
            
            # Save the enhanced frame (post-process and store)
            save_image(super_resolved_frame, os.path.join(tmp_dir, 'enhanced_' + frame_file))
    
    # Step 4: Reassemble enhanced frames into a new video
    output_video_path = '/tmp/enhanced_video.mp4'
    reassemble_video(output_video_path, tmp_dir)
    
    # Step 5: Upload the enhanced video back to S3
    s3.upload_file(output_video_path, output_s3_path['bucket'], output_s3_path['key'])
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Video processed and uploaded successfully')
    }

Step 5: Performance Optimization

Lambda functions are constrained by memory (up to 10GB), runtime (15 minutes max), and storage (10GB). The following strategies can be applied:

    Efficient Frame Processing: Process videos in small chunks or sub-sequences. You can divide the video into short segments and process them individually to stay within Lambda's limits.
    Model Optimization: Use ONNX or TensorFlow Lite models to optimize inference speed and reduce the size of models.
    Use of Temporary Storage: Store intermediate frames or results in Amazon S3 rather than the /tmp directory when dealing with large videos.

Step 6: Testing & Documentation

    Testing: Test your solution with different video sizes, resolutions, and formats. Ensure that the processing time stays within Lambda’s limits.
    Documentation: Provide detailed setup instructions for deploying the solution on AWS Lambda, including S3 bucket setup, model deployment, and Lambda function configurations.

Conclusion

This solution provides a scalable, serverless approach to applying Deep Video Super-Resolution using AWS Lambda. By utilizing state-of-the-art AI models, AWS Lambda’s computational resources, and S3 for storage, we can achieve high-quality video enhancement within the constraints of Lambda functions. Make sure to optimize each step to handle larger videos or multiple video segments efficiently while ensuring temporal consistency and high-quality results.
